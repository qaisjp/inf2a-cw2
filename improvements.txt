# Improvement 1

For some reason `Qais is not a frog.` is supported (says `OK.`), yet when you query for
`Who is not a frog?` it fails. One might find it useful to handle `not` and other negatory forms, like `isn't`.

This is especially confusing when you can say `Qais is a frog.` and then `Qais is not a frog.`. When you ask `Who is a frog?` it will then proceed to tell you that `Qais` is a frog.

This should be fairly simple to implement as it would just require an extension of the existing rules (and grammar).

# Improvement 2

When trying out sentences mentioned throughout the coursework specification (like, `Who is a duck?`), I am met with `Ehh?`. This is because the word `duck` is not in the lexicon. It would be useful to simply say `No one` in this case.

This may prove difficult as we do not know beforehand which phrases match the grammar correctly (to then extract the word), but it would be trivial to determine whether a particular word is a noun.
